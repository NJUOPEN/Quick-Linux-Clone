# Wine QQ 6.9

This is a wine patched QQ (an Chinese instant messaging software).

The package is based on "wine-tm2013-longeneteam" released in 2013.

It uses old windows libraries (from 1.7.7), but uses native (newer)
wineserver(>=1.8.0), in order to provide better compartibility.


## Change details

* Replace font "Simsun" with "Noto Sans CJK"

* Replace tm2013 with QQ6.9

* Remove unneeded drivers and executable

* Remove pre-installed gecko, and try to use cacheed MSI file

* Set system environment as "Windows 2008"
